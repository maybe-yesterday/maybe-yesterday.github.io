Attempted [Fliptile][fliptile] today.  

[My solution][mysolution]

## Takeaways

1. **Backtracking is still relevant!**  
   Even if DP is replacing a lot of it (because of efficiency and stack overflows), remember that in theory  
   [Recursion > Loops][recursion].

   Tail recursion doesn’t even need manual optimization (ngl recursion is simpler to write most of the time).

2. **Try things out!**  
   Almost did not see that basically your actions in the first row (or column) determine your actions in the entire grid!  

3. **Don’t be afraid to simplify things!**  
   Submitting optimal solutions is nice, but sometimes simpler solutions are OK.  
   Make things easier for yourself.  

## Fun

Naming this after the movie *Flipped*, because of our dynamic :D  

phf easy bitmask problem → oof will not run in time → oooooh omg I **SEE** the solution!
